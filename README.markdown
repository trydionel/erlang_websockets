# Erlang Websockets Implementation

This code was first posted by Joe Armstrong at [his site](http://armstrongonsoftware.blogspot.com/2009/12/comet-is-dead-long-live-websockets.html).  Unfortunately, it was slightly less than operational when I started to play with it.  I've resuscitated it into a working state, and hope to use this as a jumping point for learning Erlang.
